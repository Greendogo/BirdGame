Port 1 will have 4 pins I use input (rows)
Port 2 will have 3 pins I use output (columns)

for(Port 2 pin i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
	set Port2<i> to low;
	for(Port 1 pin j = 1; j <= 4; j++)
	{
		if(Port 1 pin j is low, button at (i,j) is pressed.
	}
	set Port2<i> to high;
}

Port 1 will be Port E pin 12 to 15 (3 to 0 "pins" respectively) as input
Port 2 will be Port B pin 16 to 18 (3 to 1 "pins" respectively) as output
